# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up


# Tasks
## 1-3. Complete the following tasks:
- [Count characters](countchars/count_chars.py)

## 4. Question time! (~10 mins) [4p]

###  What is inheritance? When would you use it? [2p]
#### Your answer:
The child class can inherit from the parent class. It means, that the child class can be able to use properties and methods, which use the parent class. 
We use it, when we have a class which have more common parameters and properties with other special instance, but for the special instances has some special properties too. It will be transparent with inheritance and we can avoid the code duplication.


### Name each building block of a method! [2p]
